    "# Heart rate estimation, signal de-noising and mobile health\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to study an algorithm for correctly retrieving the timing instants of an ECG (EKG) time series. We will implement a simplified variant of the [Pan-Tompkins algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122029) and we will test it on real ECG data recordings. Towards the end of the lab you will be asked to apply your algorithms to the problem of heart rate estimation using a mobile device.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this session you should be able to understand the main challenges in the estimation of EGC signals. How to work from modeling assupmtions in order to exploit your prior knowledge in the estimation task.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Note: Everything below this line should be truned in as part of your lab report._\n",

    "### Signal generation and template matching\n",
    "In this task we will implement a simple version of a QRS-complex detector by using template matching, thresholding and non-maximum suppresion on the\n",
    "observed ECG signal. We will then use those detections to provide an estimate of the heart rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Signal Generation -** We are going to create a synthetic EGC signal that we will be using to test our detector algorithm. For that purpose generate a stream of $10$ equally spaced pulses over a time span of $10\\ s$ and with a sampling rate of $f_s = 256\\ Hz$. The goal of this task is to create a basic model for a ECG signal. You can think of the signal as the convolution of a canonical pulse shape $\\varphi(t)$ with a stream of Dirac delta functions: \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$x(t) = \\sum_{k=1}^K a_k\\, \\varphi(t-t_k) = \\varphi(t) \\ast \\sum_{k=1}^K a_k\\, \\delta(t-t_k),$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "   where $K$ is the number of pulses observed, $a_k$ represent the amplitudes of the different pulses and $t_k$ correspond to the locations of the pulses in time. For the purpose of this task use the canonical pulse shape generated by the `ecg_wave()` function defined in the notebook and constant unit amplitudes $a_k=1$. Make sure to scale your function in time so that its support is only $1/10\\ s$. Plot the generated signal over time adding the appropriate labels for the axis.\n"

After normalization define a threshold value and keep only those values of the signal that are above the given threshold. Once you have done that, perform a non-maximum suppression (i.e., keep a value if it is greater than the previous and following values). To implement the thresholding and non-maximum suppression operations you can use `signal.find_peaks` function."
